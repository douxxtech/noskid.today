## How to Build

> [!Note]
> You can use the original **noskid** source code without modification. However, for improved web optimization and a more maintainable update system, we recommend building a custom version.

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Build Steps

1. Clone or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. The build output will be located in a `build/prod-<timestamp>` directory.

You're now ready to deploy or customize the project further!
