We dont like skids.

A website based on [nohello.net](https://nohello.net), but heavily modified with rich features !

> [!NOTE]
> New feature ! @is.notaskid.ong mails !:  
> Check the [website](https://im.notaskid.ong) !

> [![NoSkid Verification](https://noskid.today/badge/100x30/?repo=douxxtech/noskid.today)](https://noskid.today)


## Hosting this website
It's a php-dependent site, exept if you dont want to use the API (that would be sad).  
You also need to install the package `librsvg2-bin` to convert SVG into PNG, and php must have the exec() function allowed.

Installation: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/douxxtech/noskid.today
cd noskid.today
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```
(or use something like apache with php-fpm)

> [!TIP]
> This website contains a lot (and really, a lot) of hidden features, find them by looking at the console ! (Shift + ESC)  
> E.G: use [Shift + T to open the comments !](https://noskid.today/#spawnCommentSystem)
