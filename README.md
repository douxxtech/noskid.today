# Noskid today - please don't talk when you don't know

![togp thing](https://togp.xyz?owner=douxxtech&repo=noskid.today&theme=json-dark-all)

We dont like skids.

A website based on [nohello.net](https://nohello.net), but heavily modified with rich features !


## Hosting this website
It's a php-dependent site, exept if you dont want to use the API (that would be sad).  
You also need to install the package `librsvg2-bin` to convert SVG into PNG, and php must have the exec() function allowed.

Installation: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/douxxtech/noskid.today
cd noskid.today
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```
(or use something like apache with php-fpm)
